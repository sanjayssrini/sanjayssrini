## Hey There ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sanjay...
### A Tech Enthusiast...
---
I'm a sophomore with a passion for programming and open-source contributions. Currently, I'm exploring various domains in computer science, with a strong focus on C programming, Java, Python , database management, and cloud computing. 

## ðŸŒ± Current Learning Path
- **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**: I'm diving deep into DSA in Python, Java and C, simplifying complex concepts to learn them as a 13-year-old would. I value clean, efficient code, often preferring explicit if-else statements for readability.
- **Database Management**: Iâ€™m focused on relational databases, SQL, and PL/SQL, with hands-on experience in normalization (1NF to BCNF), relational database design, and SQL queries.
- **Cloud Computing**: As an AWS Student Cloud Clubs mentor at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham - Chennai Campus, I create interactive and energetic content to introduce cloud computing to new learners.

## ðŸš€ Projects
1. **Smart Supermarket Self Billing System**
   - A self-billing solution that utilizes a barcode scanner, C programming, and MySQL. Itâ€™s carbon-neutral, with phone-based login, OTPs, and PDF billing via WhatsApp or SMS. This project integrates a custom C-Python backend for seamless database interactions and PDF generation.

2. **CleanQuest**
   - A social media platform idea for enhancing campus sustainability, featuring an activity-based points system, AI verification, leaderboards, and a voting system. This was developed for a hackathon to encourage environmental responsibility among students.

3. **Water Level Monitoring System**
   - Built with Arduino UNO, this system monitors and reports water levels, part of a collaborative team project.

## ðŸ’¼ Hackathon Experience
I've participated in multiple hackathons, including a recent 36-hour event with my team, where we developed unique solutions for real-world problems. My hackathon experiences have helped sharpen my teamwork, ideation, and coding skills under tight deadlines.

## ðŸŽ– Certifications & Achievements
- **Contributor** for GirlScript Summer of Code Extended 2024, where I contributed to open-source projects.
- **Mentorship** with AWS Cloud Clubs, guiding students through introductory cloud computing concepts.
- **Hackathon Awards**: Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to participate and excel in hackathons focused on sustainability and social good.

## ðŸ’¡ Fun Facts
- Iâ€™m an 18-year-old with a knack for building projects with a preference for explicit, simple code.
- I enjoy protein shakes with a preferred protein content of 6-7g per serving.
- Iâ€™m also a self-learner, upgrading my skills and tools, like upgrading Python from 3.12 to 3.15 recently!
